# AGENT.md - Multi-Agent Orchestration & Recovery

## Agent Coordination Architecture (Claude Code + Copilot Pattern)
### Primary Agent Roles
1. **Assessment Agent** (Audit + Monitor)
   - Performance monitoring: Track deploy times, error rates, user satisfaction
   - Capability auditing: Evaluate new feature opportunities + technical debt
   - Risk assessment: Identify failure points + mitigation strategies

2. **Planning Agent** (Design + Architect)  
   - Architecture design: Plan feature implementations + infrastructure changes
   - Risk analysis: Evaluate rollback procedures + failure scenarios
   - Resource allocation: Coordinate development priorities + timeline management

3. **Execution Agent** (Build + Deploy)
   - Progressive deployment: Implement features via staged rollouts
   - Quality assurance: Ensure code standards + security compliance
   - Integration testing: Validate component interactions + API contracts

4. **Validation Agent** (Test + Verify)
   - Canary testing: Automated validation of new deployments
   - Performance verification: Confirm KPI targets + user experience goals
   - Security auditing: Validate access controls + data protection measures

5. **Recovery Agent** (Monitor + Respond)
   - Autonomous rollback: Detect failures + trigger automatic recovery
   - Incident response: Coordinate human intervention when required
   - Pattern learning: Document failures + enhance prevention procedures

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
### Status Broadcasting (Every Deploy)
```yaml
status_update:
  timestamp: "2024-12-26T21:28:00Z"
  deploy_id: "deploy_67c3f2a1"
  agent_reports:
    assessment: "baseline_metrics_captured_successfully"
    planning: "rollback_procedures_validated_and_ready"
    execution: "atomic_deploy_completed_zero_partial_states"
    validation: "canary_tests_passed_stakeholder_approval_confirmed"
    recovery: "monitoring_active_no_intervention_required"
```

### Escalation Triggers (Autonomous → Human)
- **Level 1**: Single agent failure → Auto-recovery attempt by Recovery Agent
- **Level 2**: Multiple agent coordination failure → Notify lead developer
- **Level 3**: System-wide impact → Emergency protocol + stakeholder alert

## Autonomous Recovery Procedures
### Deployment Failure Recovery
1. **Detection**: Validation Agent identifies failure via canary tests
2. **Assessment**: Recovery Agent evaluates impact scope + rollback safety
3. **Execution**: Automatic Netlify rollback triggered within 2 minutes
4. **Verification**: Validation Agent confirms successful recovery
5. **Learning**: Assessment Agent documents root cause + prevention measures

### Performance Degradation Response
1. **Monitoring**: Assessment Agent detects response time >2x baseline
2. **Analysis**: Planning Agent evaluates resource allocation + bottlenecks
3. **Mitigation**: Execution Agent implements cache optimization + CDN updates
4. **Validation**: Performance metrics return to acceptable range
5. **Documentation**: Recovery Agent updates performance thresholds

### Security Incident Protocols
1. **Alert**: Validation Agent detects unauthorized access attempt
2. **Response**: Recovery Agent temporarily restricts admin access
3. **Investigation**: Assessment Agent reviews access logs + session data
4. **Resolution**: Planning Agent implements additional security measures
5. **Communication**: Incident summary shared with stakeholders

## Agent Learning & Pattern Propagation
### Success Pattern Recognition
- **Deploy Preview Adoption**: When stakeholder validation increases approval rates
- **Edge Function Performance**: When global response times improve consistently  
- **Background Automation**: When manual intervention requirements decrease
- **Atomic Deploy Safety**: When zero partial failure states are maintained

### Cross-Project Knowledge Transfer
```yaml

  deployment_safety:
    source: "dchs_football_atomic_deploys"
    replication: "seatrace_api_zero_downtime_updates"
    
  stakeholder_validation:
    source: "dchs_football_deploy_previews"  
    replication: "investor_demo_approval_workflows"
    
  performance_optimization:
    source: "dchs_football_edge_functions"
    replication: "client_projects_global_cdn_implementation"
    
  operational_automation:
    source: "dchs_football_background_functions"
    replication: "enterprise_sales_demo_automation"
```

## Enterprise Coordination Framework
### Multi-Project Agent Orchestration
- **Portfolio Assessment**: Cross-project performance + risk monitoring
- **Resource Optimization**: Shared infrastructure + deployment pipeline efficiency
