# PLAN.md

## Immediate Objectives
1. âœ… Create docs/COPILOT-CLAUDE-INTEGRATION.md from provided spec
2. âœ… Add PR + Issue templates that enforce canary + rollback gates
3. âœ… Add GitHub Actions (canary.yml + guardrails.yml) and rsvp_canary.sh
4. âœ… Move ADMIN-TEAM-STRUCTURE.md + DATA-MANAGEMENT-GUIDE.md into /docs and commit
5. ðŸ”„ Set BASE_URL as repo secret or env for canary (default to prod URL)
6. ðŸ”„ Open PR titled: "Bulletproof RSVP: guardrails + Copilot integration"

## Success Metrics
- 100% canary pass on all PRs
- 0 regressions in thank-you routes
- <5 min to rollback using documented plan

## Rollback Procedure
- Revert PR via GitHub UI
- Redeploy latest successful Netlify build
- Re-run canary to validate recovery

## Bulletproof RSVP Pipeline Status
âœ… **OPERATIONAL** - All thank-you URL variants working
- `/thank-you` â†’ 200
- `/thank-you/` â†’ 200  
- `/thank-you.html` â†’ 200
- Form POST â†’ 200 (Netlify Forms)

## Current Implementation
- âœ… Canary scripts created and tested
- âœ… Fix-and-verify macro operational
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflows ready
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks installed
- âœ… Netlify.toml configured with bulletproof redirects

## Pattern Transfer Readiness
Ready to apply bulletproof patterns to:
- SeaTrace API deployment reliability
- Investor demo preparation
- Progressive validation pipelines
- Automated recovery mechanisms

## Next Sprint Goals
1. SeaTrace API reliability improvements
2. Multi-project agent coordination
3. Valuation impact measurement
4. Cross-project pattern sharing
