| Question          | Choose the right `.gitignore` and ship a production-ready `README.md` + starter files for the **DCHS-Football** repo so we can deploy fast on Netlify and start collecting RSVPs.                                                                                            |
| Plan              | Use a **Node-centric** `.gitignore` plus Netlify/OS cruft ignores (works for plain static sites and future React/Vite upgrades). Provide a plug-and-play README and a minimal site scaffold (index.html with Netlify form, thank-you page with calendar buttons, event.ics). |
